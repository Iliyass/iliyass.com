        <p>
            At least I&rsquo;m writing something..  It ain&rsquo;t about how hard you hit it&rsquo;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward &ndash; Rocky Balboa This is the latest quote that resonates with me, I have watched so many videos about self improving, psychology and philosophy, all that staff. at the end I think I have chosen the existential way, which is, this life is tragic in its nature, we constantly anxious about the future, we are wired this way, we have some glimpse of happiness, joy, but most of the time, you either neutral or anxious about something, for me personally this quote gives me a firm life perspective on how I need to live my life, no matter how you prepare for the worse, no matter how hard/cold your feelings get, you potentially could be fucked up in any way shape of form, but you need to look at it from a resistance perspective, when you are feeling disparate, betrayed, lost.
